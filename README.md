Vlocs: V Language Documentation | The **unofficial** documentation for V

Let's face it, the current documentation is awful. Some Markdown document on GitHub using all kinds of terms. This is a Documentation that is trying to be
**beginner friendly**. Additionally, it is way more in-detail. You can learn the following in this documentation

- How to install V?
- How to write V code?
- What Standard Libraries are there?
- When to use what Library?
- What functions do these libraries have and how do I use them?
