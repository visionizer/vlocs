According to [Github Repository](https://github.com/vlang/),
> V is a statically typed compiled programming language designed for building maintainable software.
> It is similar to Go and its design has also been influenced by Oberon, Rust, Swift, Kotlin and Python.
> The language promotes simple and clear code with minimal abstraction.
> Despite being simple, V gives the developer a lot of power. Anything, you can do in other languages, you can do in V.

But, what does this even mean?

 - **Statically typed**: This means that every variable has a type. An example of something that is a statically typed language is C++. In C++, you have to declare variables like this: `int foo;`
In this case, you told the compiler that the variable `foo` is an integer (Datatypes & Variables will be explained later). This means that you can use foo only where ints are accepted.
On the other hand, we have **dynamically typed langauges** like Python. You never have to declare a type in it, which also means that it is a lot slower.

 - **Compiled Programming Language**: There are two types of languages **compiled languages** and **interpreted languages**. For example, Python is an interpreted language. This means, that
 you will never receive a .exe / .deb / etc. It also means that when you run a file, it will look at one line, do what it says and then go to the next line. This is very slow. On the other hand, we have **compiled languages**, like V. This means that the compiler will turn your code into an executable.
